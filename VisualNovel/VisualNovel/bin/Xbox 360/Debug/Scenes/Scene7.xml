	They must use real pine.</StoryElement>

  <StoryInteraction>I was thinking about giving those 
  baths another try. </StoryInteraction>
  <StoryInteraction>Talk about rude. I could have been sleep walking. You shouldn’t wake a sleep walker. </StoryInteraction>

    <StoryElement>MARIKO: My manager’s looking for you. He’s already yelled at

	your bags, what will he think? </StoryElement>

  <StoryInteraction>I’m just leaving early. Junko said she would pay for all this. </StoryInteraction>
  <StoryInteraction>I left my credit card in America I wonder if I can call you when I get back and give you the number.</StoryInteraction>
  </StoryInteraction>
  <StoryElement>
    <StoryElement>MARIKO: I know you don’t have a way to pay for all this. 
	This is a five star Japanese hotel. That’s like a six star hotel in America.</StoryElement>
