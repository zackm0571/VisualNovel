  <StoryInteraction>I was thinking about giving those 
  baths another try. </StoryInteraction>

    <StoryElement>My manager’s looking for you. He’s already yelled at

  <StoryInteraction>I’m just leaving early. 
  Junko said she would pay for all this. </StoryInteraction>

  call you when I get back and give you the number.</StoryInteraction>
  </StoryInteraction>
  <StoryElement>
    <StoryElement>I know you don’t have a way to pay for all this. 
	This is a five star Japanese hotel. That’s like a six star
	hotel in America.</StoryElement>
